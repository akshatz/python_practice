# Question 7:
# A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
# Following are the criteria for checking the password:
# 1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
# 2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
# 1. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
# 3. At least 1 character from [$#@]
# 4. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
# 5. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
# Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
# Example
# If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
# ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
# Then, the output of the program should be:
# ABd1234@1
# Hints:
# In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.
